<h2> Why are tourists behaving badly?</h2>
<hr>
<p> <em>his summer, every day seems to bring another headline of tourists around the world behaving badly.</em></p>

<p><span><em>Last week, it was <u>two drunk Americans</u> sneaking into a closed section of the Eiffel Tower and sleeping off their bender high above Paris. The previous week, a French woman was arrested for carving a heart and her initials into Italy's iconic Leaning Tower of Pisa. A Canadian teen defaced a 1,200-year-old Japanese temple last month, just after a Bristol-based man etched two names into Rome's Colosseum and told authorities he was unaware of the arena's age. And who could forget the German tourist who crashed a performance inside a sacred Bali temple and stripped naked  after having previously run out on the bill at several local hotels?</em> </span></p>
